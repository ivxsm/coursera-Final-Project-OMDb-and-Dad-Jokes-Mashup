This repository has my solution to the new final project in the **Data Collection and Processing with Python** course.

## Project Overview
This project is a mashup of the **OMDb API** (for movie information) and a **Dad Jokes API**, combining data collection and processing in Python.

## Progress
- I completed the main tasks outlined in the project.
- **Note**: I did not solve the bonus challenge, I'll complete it later
## Features
- Retrieves movie information from the OMDb API.
- Fetches random dad jokes to add a fun twist to the project.
- Combines movie details and jokes into a unique output.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python üêç
- APIs: OMDb and Dad Jokes
- JSON handling
- Data processing techniques

## How to Run
This project cannot be run locally without first downloading the `requests_with_caching.get()` model. It is designed to work best within the Coursera platform.
